For proposals of scientific collaborations, advising or any  other questions, **feel free to contact me** at my professional e-mail: [riccardo.maria.bianchi@cern.ch](mailto:riccardo.maria.bianchi@cern.ch).

If you are an **artist**, I am keen on discussing collaborations for **_Art+Science_** projects.

If you are a **reporter**, I am available for **interviews** or for **comments** on subjects related to particle physics, CERN activities and experiments, scientific computing, fundamental research, history of science, data visualization, and science in general.

**I am based at CERN**, in Geneva, Switzerland. Drop me a line if you want to meet.
