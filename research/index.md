I have a *PhD* in *Particle Physics* and I am a Postdoctoral Associate at [University of Pittsburgh](http://www.physicsandastronomy.pitt.edu/people/riccardo-maria-bianchi), but I am based at CERN, in Geneva (Switzerland), where I work within the ATLAS Experiment on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

My main research activities are in the fields of
Data Analysis/Data Science, Data Visualization, Development of Scientific Software.

On my [Publications](publications.html) page you can find my scientific papers and publication.

In the last 11 years I have worked on very different topics, which let me acquire a broad knowledge of the needs and the possible issues involved in the design and running a scientific experiment.

In particular my activities focused on:

## Current work-in-progress projects

* Design and development of new common tools for interactive data visualization, with a server-client architecture and *in-situ* characteristics.
* New tools to persistify, handle and serve geometry data. The last phase of this project involves the design and the deployment of RESTful data services on clusters, through graph databases (Neo4j) and search engines (ElasticSearch)
* A Machine Learning + Visualization project, in collaboration with Argonne (US), to classify and analyze events through the analysis of graphical representation of physics data

Recently, I also conceived, promoted and started two interdisciplinary projects, mainly in *Digital Humanities*, through collaborations with two external Institutes:

* EPFL (Losanne) - Network visualization of collaboration data, focused on the visualization of large collaborations of institutes and people, to extract information about the connections. That project implies complex tasks of scouting, collection and cleaning of very heterogeneous data (papers, theses, reports, HR data, collaboration data, ...). The common project is based on the work done at EPFL and it aims at the visualization of data about the ATLAS Collaboration.
* UNIGE (Geneve) - Machine learning techniques applied to computational linguistics.   

<!-- in order to apply the techniques and the tools I develop for Particle Physics in other fields: -->
