I am a particle physicist working at <a href="http://www.cern.ch">CERN</a> in Geneva (Switzerland) on the <a href="http://atlas.cern/">ATLAS Experiment</a>.

I am currently affiliated with the Department of <a href="http://www.physicsandastronomy.pitt.edu/">Physics and Astronomy</a> of the
<a href="http://www.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh</a> (US) as a Postdoctoral Associate.

I am specialized in searches for Supersymmetric particles, model-independent searches for new physics, data analysis, interactive data visualization, design and development of scientific software and parallel computing.

I coordinate the activities of the "Visualization" working group of the [HEP Software Foundation (HSF)](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/), which fosters common project and coordinated effort on data visualization among experiments, and of the ATLAS Experiment's "Going Virtual" group, which explores the possibilities of new technologies, like Virtual and Augmented Reality, in scientific data visualization.

Besides writing scientific papers, I recently contributed to the book [_Applied Computational Physics_](/menu/writing.html), which is out now, published by [Oxford University Press](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/applied-computational-physics-9780198708643?cc=ch&lang=en&).
